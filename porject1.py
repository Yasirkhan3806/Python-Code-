# String Techniques:
# course = "Python for beginners"
# print(course[0:3]) #this technique will return the string character inlcuding the first index defined but the excluded the character on second index and but default their value are [0:last character of the string]

# Formatted Strings
# First_name = 'Yasir'
# Last_Name = 'Khan'
#Now there are two ways to print this
# message = First_name + ' [ ' + Last_Name + ' ] ' + 'is the best coder in the world'
# print(message)
# #Or we use formatted string that starts with f with is more simple and understandable
# msg = f'{First_name} [{Last_Name}] is the best coder in the world'
# print(msg)

# STRING METHOD ,RUN THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM TO UNDERSTAND
# Remeber all of the mention methods are case sensitive
# message = "How are you"
# print(len(message))
# print(message.upper())
# print(message.lower())
# print(message.find('How'))
# print(message.replace('are', 'my'))
# # in operator is special boolean operator that finds a word in a string and return boolean value lets see(it is also case sensitive
# print('you' in message)

# # float division
# print(10 / 3)
# #Integar division

# #Power operator
# print(10 ** 3)
